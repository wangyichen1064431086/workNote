## Refs and the DOM
In the typical React dataflow, props are the only way that parent components interact with their children. To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow. The child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element. For both of these cases, React provides an escape hatch.

在典型的React数据流中，props是父组件和子组件交互的唯一方式。要修改一个child，你就要用新的props重新渲染它。但是，在少数情况下，你需要在典型的数据流以外强制修改child。要修改的child可以是一个React组件实例，也可以试试一个DOM element。对于这两种情况，React提供了一个逃生舱口。

### When to Use Refs
There are a few good use cases for refs:
- Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
- Triggering imperative animations.
- Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

有几种使用refs的好的场景：
- 管理焦点，文本选择或媒体播放。
- 触发必要的动画
- 整合第三方DOM库

Avoid using refs for anything that can be done declaratively.

避免使用refs来做任何可以声明式地完成的事情。

For example, instead of exposing open() and close() methods on a Dialog component, pass an isOpen prop to it.

例如，在Dialog component上，应该避免使用open()和close()方法，而应该传递一个isOpen的prop给它。

### Don’t Overuse Refs: 不要过度使用Refs
Your first inclination may be to use refs to “make things happen” in your app. If this is the case, take a moment and think more critically about where state should be owned in the component hierarchy. Often, it becomes clear that the proper place to “own” that state is at a higher level in the hierarchy. See the Lifting State Up guide for examples of this.
